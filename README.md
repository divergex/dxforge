**dxforge** is the orchestration suite within the Divergex ecosystem, designed to enable seamless service discovery,
secure communication, and containerized infrastructure management for high-performance quantitative research and trading
systems. It is built to coordinate the interactions between services, facilitating scalability, security, and efficient
deployment of microservices across various environments.

## Main Functionalities

### 1. **Service Discovery**

- Automatically identifies and registers services in the ecosystem.
- Allows for dynamic discovery of available services, improving flexibility and reducing manual configuration.
- Supports decentralized service registration for efficient resource utilization and fault tolerance.

### 2. **Mesh Registration**

- Ensures that services within the ecosystem are properly registered within a service mesh.
- Provides routing capabilities, load balancing, and service-to-service communication.

### 3. **Containerization and Orchestration**

- Leverages containerization for isolating services, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and
  production.
- Works with Docker and Kubernetes to deploy, manage, and scale services.
- Automates the orchestration of services, ensuring that dependencies and service states are managed efficiently.

### 4. **Cross-Service Communication**

- Provides tools and libraries to support communication between services through APIs, RPC calls, and message queues.
- Integrates with FastAPI, gRPC, and other protocols to enable high-performance interactions between microservices.

## Features

- **Scalability**: Easily scale services up and down based on demand.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Incorporates resiliency features like retries, fallbacks, and circuit breakers.
- **Interoperability**: Supports integration with other components of the Divergex ecosystem, including `dxcore` and
  `dxlib`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.x (for CLI and development)

### Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/divergex/dxforge.git
cd dxforge
```

Build the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Run the services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You can now interact with your services as needed.

## Usage

Once set up, you can configure your services to interact via **dxforge** for service discovery, mesh registration, and
secure communication. To enable these features:

1. **Service Registration**: Register services with the built-in discovery mechanism.
2. **Inter-Service Communication**: Utilize the provided protocols and channels for secure messaging.
3. **Scaling**: Leverage Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to scale services automatically based on load.

Use either the CLI or access the web ui at `http://localhost:7000` to manage your services.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the development of **dxforge**, please follow the steps below:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Submit a pull request.

We welcome contributions to improve the functionality and performance of **dxforge**!
